# my_malloc
This program is an implementation I wrote for the malloc system call. My-malloc.c dynamically allocates memory to implement malloc, calloc, realloc, and free. The program also includes a Makefile, which contains commands to compile the code, test its accuracy using a test file mallocTest.c, and load it into the gdb debugger. The code was written and in a VirtualBox running ArchLinux, and to test its working accuracy there are commands to test calls to ls. This program was created for the course Systems Programming.
