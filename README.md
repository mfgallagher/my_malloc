# my_malloc
This repository contains the code for an implementation I wrote for malloc, which works with the -a and -l options. 
The code was written and executed inside a VirtualBox running ArchLinux. The code also contains a Makefile, which
stores the commands to compile and run the code, as well as a test program to make sure that the implementation works.
The -a options will lists all files and directories within a directory, and the -l option will provide more information,
such as permissions and last editing, for all files in the directory. The options can be used independently or together. Following 
these, users can either input nothing, returning info about the current directory, or input various paths to files/directories
on the system.
